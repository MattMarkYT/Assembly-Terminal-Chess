# assembly-terminal-chess
Chess written in Intel 8008 Masm Assembly

So far I've spent time theorizing and implemented the base of chess in the data section. This will save time later as I won't really have to look back on code and make changes to add new features.

To Do:
- Logic for each movement type (diagonal, parallel, L, forward only)
- Check conditions
- Win conditions
- Stalemate conditions
