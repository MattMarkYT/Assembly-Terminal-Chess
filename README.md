To Do:
- Win conditions (Checkmate, resign)
- Stalemate conditions (King has no valid moves, insufficient material)
- Castling

Optionally:
- Save games for later
- Add custom boards read in from text files
- Add piece movement customization
- After all else, maybe an interface inside the game to create a board
