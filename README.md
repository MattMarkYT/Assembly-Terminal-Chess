# assembly-terminal-chess
Chess written in x86 MASM Assembly

As of October 23, 2025, it is fully playable from start to checkmate

To Do:
- Stalemate conditions (King has no valid moves, insufficient material)
- Castling
- Refactoring for readability

Optionally:
- Save games for later
- Add custom boards read in from text files
- Add piece movement customization
- After all else, maybe an interface inside the game to create a board
